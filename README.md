# Poca-Discord-Bot
[Replit link of a discord bot made by me with discord.py](https://replit.com/@quantsr/Poca-Bot#music_cog.py)

This bot was created by me and is currently being hosted by a mini server that stays alive through the use of an [uptime robot](https://uptimerobot.com).

The bot has currently many functions I made in order to experiment with functionalities and API's

Notable mentions of commands:

!ping : Mentions a random person in the server

!fuckoff : Uses the [Fuck Off As A Service](https://foaas.herokuapp.com) API in order to send a message to someone in the server. It also displays a screenshot of the website that the API generates, which is neat.

!duel : Sends a duel request of Rock-Paper-Scissors to someone in the server as a PM. Both participants can send their imputs and the bot will announce the winner on the server.

!play : Plays a youtube audio on the voice channel you're connected.


The bot currently has no possible invite link since it's just a development experiment. It is in no way ready, or interesting to be used seriously by other servers. The entire purpose of the bot was so I could learn how to make a discord bot using discord.py and share the results with my inner circle of friends
